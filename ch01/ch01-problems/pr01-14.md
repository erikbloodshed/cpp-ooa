PR-14. Design an algorithm to find the sales tax and the total sale value of a
       transaction made of two soft drinks (1 dollar each), three bottles of
       milk (2 dollars each), and one can of coffee (3 dollars). The tax is 9
       percent.

*Solution:*  
```
Let softdrinks = 2
Let softdrink_price = 1.00
Let milk_bottles = 3
Let milk_bottles_price = 2.00
Let coffee_can = 1
Let coffee_can_price = 3.00
Let tax = 0.09

Let amount1 = softdrinks * softdrink_price
Let amount2 = milk_bottles * milk_bottles_price
Let amount3 = coffee_can * coffee_can_price

Let total_sale = amount1 + amount2 + amount3
Let sales_tax = total_sale * tax

Return total_sale, sales_tax
```
